# Networking for Engineers

Welcome to the Networking for Engineers project! This template contains Python scripts to automate the configuration of Cisco devices. It's designed to be a starting point for various networking projects. The first project example provided is for "Tom's Computer Repair Shop," focusing on configuring a single Cisco switch.

## Introduction

The Networking for Engineers project aims to simplify the process of configuring Cisco devices using Python. By leveraging libraries such as `netmiko` and `pyyaml`, we provide a streamlined and automated approach to network device configuration. The initial project example, "Tom's Computer Repair Shop," demonstrates configuring a single Cisco switch.

## Features

- **Automated Base Configuration**: Apply common base settings to your Cisco devices.
- **Interface Configuration**: Configure interfaces with ease.
- **Routing Configuration**: Set up routing protocols like OSPF and EIGRP.
- **Modular Design**: Each configuration task is modularized for better maintainability.
- **Configuration Management**: Load configurations from YAML files.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.6 or later installed on your machine.
- Access to the Cisco device(s) you want to configure.
- The following Python packages:
  - `netmiko`
  - `pyyaml`
  - `pytest` (for running tests)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/networking_projects.git
   cd networking_projects
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Template Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd templates/networking_for_engineers
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Device Configuration**:
   Edit the `config/device_config.yaml` file to include your Cisco device details:
   ```yaml
   devices:
     - hostname: "192.168.1.1"
       username: "admin"
       password: "password"
       secret: "enable_password"
       device_type: "cisco_ios"
   ```

2. **Secrets Management**:
   Store sensitive information such as passwords in `config/secrets.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   enable_password: "your_enable_password"
   ```

   **Note**: Ensure that `secrets.yaml` is listed in your `.gitignore` file to keep it secure.

## Usage

1. **Run the Main Script**:
   Execute the main script to apply configurations:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Run Specific Configuration Scripts**:
   You can also run individual scripts for specific configurations:
   ```bash
   python scripts/base_config.py
   python scripts/interface_config.py
   python scripts/routing_config.py
   ```
