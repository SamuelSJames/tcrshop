Sure! Below is a Markdown file explaining the purpose of the `server` directory.

### `server` Directory Overview

The `server` directory is designed to store scripts and configurations specifically for managing and setting up the Ubuntu server. This directory acts as a central repository for all server-related scripts, making it easier to manage, deploy, and maintain various configurations and automation tasks.

### Purpose of the `server` Directory

The main purpose of the `server` directory is to organize scripts and configuration files that are essential for the administration and setup of the Ubuntu server. This includes:

- Network configuration scripts
- Setup scripts for services and applications
- Maintenance and automation scripts

### Example: Setup Bonding and VLANs

One of the key scripts stored in the `server` directory is `setup_bonding_and_vlans.sh`. This script is used to configure network bonding and VLANs on the Ubuntu server, which is particularly useful for ensuring high availability and efficient network traffic management. You may have to modify the script to fit you specific needs.

#### Script: `setup_bonding_and_vlans.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status
set -e

# Ensure the script is run as root
if [ "$(id -u)" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "This script must be run as root" >&2
  exit 1
fi

# Install necessary packages
echo "Installing necessary packages..."
apt-get update
apt-get install -y ifenslave vlan

# Load necessary kernel modules
echo "Loading kernel modules..."
modprobe bonding
modprobe 8021q

# Ensure kernel modules are loaded at boot
echo "Ensuring kernel modules load at boot..."
echo "bonding" >> /etc/modules
echo "8021q" >> /etc/modules

# Configure network interfaces
echo "Configuring network interfaces..."
cat <<EOL > /etc/network/interfaces
# Bonding interface
auto bond0
iface bond0 inet manual
    bond-mode 802.3ad
    bond-miimon 100
    bond-slaves ens1 ens2

# Physical interfaces
auto ens1
iface ens1 inet manual
    bond-master bond0

auto ens2
iface ens2 inet manual
    bond-master bond0

# VLAN interfaces on bond0
auto bond0.12
iface bond0.12 inet static
    address 192.168.12.10
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    vlan-raw-device bond0

auto bond0.14
iface bond0.14 inet static
    address 192.168.14.10
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    vlan-raw-device bond0

auto bond0.16
iface bond0.16 inet static
    address 192.168.16.10
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    vlan-raw-device bond0
EOL

# Restart networking service
echo "Restarting networking service..."
systemctl restart networking

# Check the status of the bonding interface
echo "Checking bond0 status..."
cat /proc/net/bonding/bond0

# Check the status of the VLAN interfaces
echo "Checking VLAN interfaces status..."
ip -d link show bond0.12
ip -d link show bond0.14
ip -d link show bond0.16

echo "Setup complete. The bond0 interface and VLANs should be configured and up."
```

### Conclusion

The `server` directory serves as an organized collection of essential scripts for managing and configuring the Ubuntu server. By storing scripts like `setup_bonding_and_vlans.sh` in this directory, system administrators can ensure that server configurations are consistently applied and maintained, facilitating smoother operations and easier management.
